Create a full Android app in *Kotlin* using Android Studio, named *"SpyMe – Mic & Camera Access Detector"*. This is for a cybersecurity college project.

🎯 Objective:
Build an app that detects when the device’s *microphone or camera* is accessed by any app. When detection occurs, it should:
1. Save a log locally
2. Send a *real-time alert to Firebase Realtime Database*
3. Show current status and access history in the app UI

✅ Core Functionalities:
1. Use AppOpsManager to detect mic/camera usage
2. Use UsageStatsManager to detect the foreground app during access
3. Use a *ForegroundService* to monitor continuously in the background
4. On detection:
   - Store log in local storage (Room DB or SharedPreferences)
   - Push data to Firebase under /alerts/{timestamp} with structure:
     json
     {
       "app": "Instagram",
       "type": "microphone",
       "time": "2025-07-07 15:30"
     }
     
   - Optionally show a local notification to the phone user

✅ UI Design (activity_main.xml):
- Live status indicator (e.g., "Monitoring On")
- Last accessed app (e.g., "Camera used by WhatsApp")
- Scrollable log list (RecyclerView or ListView)
- Toggle to enable/disable monitoring

📦 Project Structure:
- MainActivity.kt → UI logic and toggle
- MonitorService.kt → Foreground service
- FirebaseHelper.kt → Push alerts to Firebase
- AppUsageHelper.kt → Get foreground app
- LogEntry.kt → Data class
- LogDatabase.kt → (Room DB)
- activity_main.xml → UI Layout

⚙ Required Permissions:
- PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS
- FOREGROUND_SERVICE
- INTERNET
- POST_NOTIFICATIONS (for Android 13+)
- Add code to request usage access if not already granted

🛠 Tech Stack:
- Kotlin
- AndroidX Jetpack
- Firebase Realtime Database SDK
- ForegroundService
- Room (or SharedPreferences if simpler)
- Material Components UI

📱 Android Version Compatibility:
- API level 26 (Android 8) to API 34 (Android 15)
- Handle OS restrictions gracefully:
  - Use fallback messages on Android 8–10 if exact app name not available

📤 Firebase:
- Include Firebase SDK dependencies in build.gradle
- Use google-services.json for configuration
- Firebase Realtime DB rules: allow read/write for demo

📝 Notes:
- This is an ethical project to demonstrate how users can protect their privacy by getting notified when any background app accesses their mic or camera.
- No malicious activity or data collection
- Include comments in code for each function
- Make sure app is Android Studio compatible and ready to run

📌 Final Deliverables:
- Full Kotlin code
- XML UI
- Firebase integration
- Foreground service
- Local logging
- Firebase alert push
